A Configurable Discord Bot

Currently this bot will be required that users run and configure their own version of the bot.
I prefer it this way as it doesn't require me to focus on my bot for other's use, but also because it can be more immersive if you get to set your own bot's picture and name. Not to mention security being your own responsibility.

### Disclaimer
This bot is a big bot. in it's current state it's no where nearly as polished as the end product will hopefully be. 

This project is currently in progress once more.
